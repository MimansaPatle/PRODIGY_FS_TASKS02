## 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "What was the biggest challenge you faced?"
**A**: "The biggest challenge was implementing the profile update functionality. The issue was that updates showed success but data didn't change. Through systematic debugging, I discovered the User model was missing the email field. I added the field to the schema, created a utility script to update existing users, and fixed the frontend synchronization. This taught me the importance of schema design and the need to restart servers after model changes."

### Q: "How did you ensure security?"
**A**: "I implemented multiple security layers: JWT tokens for authentication, bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for password hashing, input validation on both client and server sides, protected API routes with middleware, and proper environment variable management. I also used .gitignore to prevent sensitive data from being committed to version control."

### Q: "What makes your UI professional?"
**A**: "I created the Electrox Design System, a government-grade design system with consistent color palettes using CSS variables, reusable component architecture, smooth animations, and mobile-first responsive design. I replaced all emojis with professional CSS-based icons and implemented a comprehensive toast notification system for user feedback."

### Q: "How did you handle state management?"
**A**: "I used React Context API for global state management, specifically for authentication state and toast notifications. This provided a clean way to share state across components without prop drilling. I also used local state with useState for component-specific data and useEffect for side effects like API calls."

### Q: "What would you improve if you had more time?"
**A**: "I would add email notifications for important events, implement advanced analytics with charts, add audit logging for compliance, create a mobile app version, and implement real-time updates using WebSockets. I'd also add automated testing with Jest and Cypress, and set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments."
